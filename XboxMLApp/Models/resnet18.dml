This is a placeholder for the ResNet-18 model file.
In a real implementation, you would need to:

1. Convert a pre-trained ResNet-18 model to ONNX format
2. Optimize the ONNX model for DirectML
3. Save the model in your own DirectML format or use the ONNX model directly

This file would be replaced with the actual model file before deploying to Xbox.
